# Wasteland RPG

Welcome to *Wasteland RPG*, a text-based colony management simulation set in a harsh post-apocalyptic world. Build and lead your colony through survival challenges, managing settlers, resources, and threats in a gritty wasteland environment. This project is under active development, blending strategic decision-making with immersive lore inspired by games like RimWorld.

## Overview

- **Genre**: Text-based colony management simulation
- **Status**: Early alpha (as of August 27, 2025)
- **Goal**: Create a scalable, engaging sim with a planned Notoriety system to track your colonyâ€™s reputation and influence gameplay dynamics.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Backend**: Node.js (version of truth for data and logic)
  - **Frontend**: React (focuses on displaying state and facilitating player decisions)
  - **Future**: Mobile frontend (architecture to be confirmed, targeting MAUI or similar)

## Features

### Done
- **Login**: Basic authentication implemented, though token expiry issues need resolution.
- **Registration**: Allows new players to create accounts.
- **Initial Colonist Selection**: Players can choose their first settler from a generated pool, with lore-driven mechanics shaping the experience.

### In Progress
- **Homestead Cleanup**: Early implementation of the first survival task, where players manage their settler to clear debris and establish a foothold.

### To Do
- **Map**: Develop a wasteland map for navigation and exploration.
- **Settler Management**: Expand settler stats, skills, and traits with deeper management options.
- **Inventory**: Implement resource tracking and storage.
- **Crafting**: Add crafting mechanics for tools and items.
- **Farming**: Introduce food production to sustain the colony.
- **Defence**: Create systems to protect against raiders and threats.
- **Attack**: Enable offensive actions to expand or retaliate.
- **(Many More Things!)**: Future plans include events, morale systems, and more lore-driven content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)  
- npm or yarn
- Docker (recommended) OR MongoDB installed locally

### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eureka-dot-net/WastelandRPG.git
cd WastelandRPG/API
./setup.sh  # Automatically configures MongoDB and environment
npm run dev
```

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eureka-dot-net/WastelandRPG.git
   cd WastelandRPG
   ```

2. Set up MongoDB (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Docker (recommended)
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
   
   # Or install MongoDB locally
   # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
   ```

3. Install and configure API:
   ```bash
   cd API
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/wasteland_rpg
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Install and start Client:
   ```bash
   cd ../Client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the app at `http://localhost:5173` (Client) and API at `http://localhost:3000`

### Database Options

The API supports multiple database configurations:

1. **Docker MongoDB** (recommended): `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest`
2. **Local MongoDB**: Install locally and use default connection
3. **MongoDB Atlas**: Free cloud database at https://www.mongodb.com/atlas  
4. **In-Memory Database**: Automatic fallback when no external database is configured (requires internet access)

### Known Issues
- **Database Connection**: Use the setup script or follow database setup instructions above
- **Login Token Expiry**: Current implementation has token expiry bugs; work in progress to stabilize authentication.

## Development
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js, handling API routes for settler generation, selection, and future features. The database (MongoDB) serves as the version of truth.
- **Frontend**: React-based, designed to display game state and collect player inputs. Uses Material-UI for UI components and dynamic icon rendering via `react-icons`.
- **Mobile Plans**: Future mobile frontend TBD, likely using .NET MAUI for cross-platform support.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with clear descriptions of changes. Focus areas include bug fixes (e.g., token expiry), feature development (e.g., homestead cleanup), and lore expansion.

## Roadmap
- **Short-Term**: Resolve login issues, complete homestead cleanup, and add basic settler management.
- **Mid-Term**: Implement map and inventory systems, introduce Notoriety mechanics.
- **Long-Term**: Expand with crafting, farming, defence, attack, and a mobile release.
